y86-asm
-------

An assembler and linker for the y86_64 instruction set, as described in
"Computer Systems" by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron.

Note that the immediate values are serialized with host-endianness, so
big-endian machines aren't supported.


building
--------

Run `make`. It'll probably work. If it doesn't, try using GCC and GNU Make.


current status
--------------

All instructions are implemented and tested.

The following features are unimplemented:

  multiple instructions/line
      (i.e., popq %rdi; ret)

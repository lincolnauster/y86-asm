y86-asm
-------

An assembler and linker for the y86_64 instruction set, as described in
"Computer Systems" by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron.

Note that the C version serializes immediate values with host-endianness, so
big-endian machines aren't supported (good luck finding one of those, though!).
